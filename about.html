        <h1>About YS Club</h1>
<p>
YS Club is the original creator of 3D Wojak animations on YouTube. This website, 3DWojak.com, was created to share free, high-quality 3D Wojak models and assets with meme creators, video editors, and fans of Wojak culture around the world.
</p>

<p>
The goal of this site is to make it easier for anyone to create and remix Wojak memes, especially in the 3D format. All characters and models on this site are original 3D works, not copied from other sources. You are free to download and use them in your own content, whether it’s for fun, commentary, parody, or animation.
</p>

<p>
This site is managed and updated by YS Club, a small YouTube creator who started 3D Wojak animations in 2024. Our videos include satirical commentary, generational humor, and reflections on internet culture, often featuring characters like Zoomer, Boomer, Chad, NPC, and others.
</p>

<p>
We also welcome community engagement! If you’ve created a meme or video using our 3D Wojaks, please feel free to share it. In the future, we plan to add a creator gallery, ranking system, and custom meme generator.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for visiting and being part of the 3D Wojak community.
